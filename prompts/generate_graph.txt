You are generating visual content slides to accompany a section of a technical video.

The speaker said:
---
{transcript_text}
---

Generate 1–3 content slides that together fully illustrate what is being explained.
Use multiple slides for complex topics; vary slide types to cover different angles.

Output ONLY a JSON array of slide objects — no markdown fences, no explanation.

Each slide must have a "type" field. Supported types:

1. Graph — flowcharts, architectures, system relationships, data flows:
{
  "type": "graph",
  "title": "Short title (5 words max)",
  "nodes": [{"id": "A", "label": "Label", "shape": "box"}, ...],
  "edges": [{"from": "A", "to": "B", "label": "optional"}]
}
Shapes: "box" (default), "diamond" (decisions/conditions), "circle" (start/end), "rounded" (processes)
4–12 nodes; concise labels (5 words max); all edge from/to must match a node id.

2. Bullets — key points, trade-offs, summaries, comparisons, pros/cons:
{
  "type": "bullets",
  "title": "Short title (5 words max)",
  "points": ["First key point.", "Second key point.", "Third key point."]
}
3–6 points; each 1 sentence max; be specific and technical.

3. Code — code snippets, SQL, config, pseudocode, CLI commands:
{
  "type": "code",
  "title": "Short title",
  "language": "python",
  "code": "# actual code here"
}
Language: one of "python", "sql", "bash", "javascript", "go", "yaml", "text"
Keep code concise (≤20 lines); include only what the speaker described.

Guidelines:
- Use 1 slide for simple topics, 2–3 for complex ones with distinct aspects
- A graph + bullets pairing works well for "what it does" + "why/trade-offs"
- A code slide adds value when the speaker shows or describes concrete syntax
- Only include content the speaker explicitly discussed
- Be technical and precise — this audience is engineers

You are generating an animated flowchart to visually accompany a section of a technical video.

The speaker said the following:
---
{transcript_text}
---

Generate a graph with nodes and directed edges that illustrates what is being described.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact schema — no markdown fences, no explanation:
{
  "title": "Brief diagram title (5 words max)",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "A", "label": "Node Label", "shape": "box"},
    {"id": "B", "label": "Decision?",  "shape": "diamond"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "A", "to": "B", "label": "optional edge label"}
  ]
}

Shape options:
- "box"      — default rectangular node
- "diamond"  — decisions / branches / conditions
- "circle"   — start / end / terminal points
- "rounded"  — processes / actions / steps

Rules:
- Node labels: max 5 words, concise
- Edge labels: optional, 1-4 words only
- 4–12 nodes total; omit trivial intermediate nodes
- Only illustrate what the speaker explicitly described
- All "from"/"to" values must match an existing node "id"

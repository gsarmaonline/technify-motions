You are generating a diagram to visually accompany a section of a technical video/lecture.

The speaker said the following:
---
{transcript_text}
---

Generate a {diagram_dsl} diagram that accurately illustrates what is being described.

Requirements:
- The diagram must be syntactically valid {diagram_dsl}
- Keep it focused: only include what the speaker explicitly described
- Use clear, concise labels
- For Mermaid: start with the diagram type declaration (e.g. `flowchart TD`, `sequenceDiagram`, etc.)
- For D2: use valid D2 syntax

Respond with ONLY the raw diagram code, no explanation, no markdown fences.

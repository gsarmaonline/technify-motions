You are analyzing a timestamped transcript to identify segments that would benefit from a visual diagram or illustration.

Cast a WIDE net. Include any segment that mentions or discusses:
- Systems, databases, APIs, services, or infrastructure (even critically — e.g. "their database design is flawed because...")
- Processes, workflows, algorithms, or sequences of steps
- Data models, schemas, or entity relationships
- Architecture decisions, design patterns, or technical trade-offs
- How components, services, or people interact
- Technical concepts being explained or compared

The speaker does NOT need to be giving a tutorial. A critique, analysis, or casual discussion of a technical system is equally valid — a diagram showing what they're describing helps the viewer understand it.

Diagram types:
- flowchart: processes, algorithms, decision trees, step-by-step flows
- sequence: interactions between systems/services/users over time (API calls, request/response, etc.)
- architecture: system components and how they connect (good for database design, service topology, infra)
- state: state machines, lifecycle diagrams
- er: data models, database schemas, entity relationships, table structures
- class: object-oriented design, class hierarchies

Group CONSECUTIVE related segments into a single "scene" (a continuous block about one topic). Scenes can be 10–120 seconds long.

Respond with a JSON array of scenes. If there is truly nothing technical at all, return an empty array [].

Schema:
[
  {
    "start": <float, seconds>,
    "end": <float, seconds>,
    "segment_indices": [<int>, ...],
    "content_type": "<one of the types above>",
    "description": "<one sentence: what technical concept this scene is describing>"
  }
]

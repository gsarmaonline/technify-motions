You are analyzing a timestamped transcript to identify segments that contain technical or engineering content that would benefit from a visual diagram or workflow illustration.

For each segment of the transcript below, determine:
1. Whether it contains technical content worth visualizing
2. If yes, what TYPE of diagram best represents it

Diagram types:
- flowchart: step-by-step process, decision trees, algorithms
- sequence: interactions between systems/services/people over time
- architecture: system components and how they connect
- state: state machines, lifecycle diagrams
- er: data models, database schemas, entity relationships
- class: object-oriented design, class hierarchies

Group CONSECUTIVE related segments into a single "scene" (a continuous block of explanation about one topic).

Respond with a JSON array of scenes. Only include scenes with technical content. Non-technical segments should be omitted.

Schema:
[
  {
    "start": <float, seconds>,
    "end": <float, seconds>,
    "segment_indices": [<int>, ...],
    "content_type": "<one of the types above>",
    "description": "<one sentence: what this scene is explaining>"
  }
]
